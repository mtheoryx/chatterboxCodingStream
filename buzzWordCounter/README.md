# Buzz Word Counter
This is chatterboxcoders first project of 2021. 

Every couple of months people start using new buzzwords. Let's catch people out for this behaviour. Everytime someone uses a buzzword in chat. We will set a buzzer and make some sound effects. If we reach 100 buzzwords in a single stream. something crazy happens.

MILESTONES:
- OpenSource a buzzword list
- Track buzzwords
- If 100 buzzwords are used in a single stream, some overlay craziness happens.
- Track most popular buzzword on a dashboard
